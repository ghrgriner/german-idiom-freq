The `headword` column in input/dewk_redewendungen_and_regex.txt
(and the identical column in input/sample_config.txt)
is the union of (1) an unmodified list of all entries in the 'Redewendung' category on
the German-language Wiktionary retrieved June 18, 2025, and (2) an unmodified list of
all entries in the 'German idioms' category on the English-language Wiktionary
retrieved July 11, 2025:
   (1) https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kategorie:Redewendung_(Deutsch)
   (2) https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:German_idioms

List (1) is made available on the German-language Wiktionary under the license

List (2) is made available on the English-language Wiktionary under the license

The `link_de` and `link_en` columns in the file in the output/ directory
are transformations of the `headword` column into a URL according to
Wiktionary conventions.
These links link to the Wiktionary page for an item in list (1) and/or (2), respectively,
for each idiom in list (1) and/or (2). From there, a link to a page with authorship history
is available.

Creation of the output file uses a corpus (three corpus files) derived from the
February 2022 extract of the German-language Wikipedia as created by
Philip May, available for download at:
    https://github.com/GermanT5/wikipedia2corpus
with the files themselves at:
    https://github.com/GermanT5/wikipedia2corpus/releases/download/v1.0/dewiki-20220201-clean-part-01
    https://github.com/GermanT5/wikipedia2corpus/releases/download/v1.0/dewiki-20220201-clean-part-02
    https://github.com/GermanT5/wikipedia2corpus/releases/download/v1.0/dewiki-20220201-clean-part-03

The Wikipedia extract was modified to create the corpus file. Philip May
gives this description on the GitHub page linked two paragraphs above:
"We use WikiExtractor to extract the Wikipedia database dumps. The texts
 are split into sentences by using SoMaJo. Each line of the text corpus
 contains one single sentence. Between each Wikipedia article is a blank line."

Before using the corpus file in our program we concatenated the three
files, unzipped the resulting file, took a 10% sample of lines and sorted
the results before saving the output. The saved file then had empty lines
removed before processing. Example code is provided in `download_sample.py`,
but the key point to document reproducibility is to note that after setting
seed=692031 for the random number generator, each line had a random number
assigned using `random.random()`. Lines where this value was <= .10 were
retained. Python v3.13.3 was used.

The corpus file was then processed without further modification to generate the
counts of matches but the resulting counts were sometimes then corrected
to obtain the frequency estimate of each idiom. (See README.md and other
project documentation for details.)

The corpus files are not distributed with this program.
